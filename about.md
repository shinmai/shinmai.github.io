In this blog, I'll be trying my darndest to post every single day five tracks that I've listened to in the previous 24 hours that stood out for me.  

- I'll try to feature mostly new music.  
- I won't post resonings for the picks, or write reviews. 
- The tracks will be in no particular order
- Genres will be all over the place, but currently I expect there'll be a fair amount of electronic music.  
- I'll try to prefer official SoundCloud links, and failing that official YouTube links.
